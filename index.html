            <h5>Developer<span> & Creator</span></h5> 
            <p><span>Hi, My name is Bilal.</span> I am a recent graduate from <span>Generation UK</span>, a provider of Pre-Apprenticeship boot camps.<br><br> I enrolled in Software Development and have learnt a wealth of new things, thanks to an experienced instructor.<br><br>
                These 'things' include <span>HTML, CSS, JS, TypeScript, Node.JS</span> as well as certain work philosophies such as <span>AGILE</span> and frameworks, namely <span>SCRUM.</span><br><br>
                As a result i have developed a working website portfolio, and attached are a handful of projects i have been working on over the intense <span>6 week</span> course.<br><br>
                I am planning to make my way into this field, to further develop my skills as well as my self in an effort to change my life from one where i was experiencing verbal abuse on a regular basis to one of constant growth and creativity.<br><br>
                Prior to this I have self-taught the new spec MEI Mathematics and OCR Physics A-Levels, and am planning to take Further Mathematics in October of 2022.</p>

            <h3>Became the go to news source for my (still) favourite game, AVA.</h3>
            <p> Through consistent and polished publications of AVA player guides, weapon guides and the re-packaging of Korean AVA updates as well as general bug fixes, i singlehandedly kept the EU/NA community interested in the development of the game.The Asian versions of the game received updates months ahead of the EU/NA community and since most of those updates landed here with us, i started translating these foreign websites to extract relevant update information. I managed to gain recognition, amassing 10's of thousands of views and working my way up to a volunteer position within EnMasse Entertainment. In the same year, i became Head Moderator for Black Squad's Discord Server, a similar (but ultimately inferior) game, which hosted 50,000 active members at the time. </p>

            <p> Here i managed to re-develop many of my social skills, transforming from a timid, tempremental being to one of confidence, balanced with an undertanding of the customer and envrionment around me. It was initially a difficult journey but through endeavour i managed to learn through embaressing moments, landing me a position within management in just over a year. 2 and a months after i was then offered to be trained for an Assistant Manager role, marking my exponential progress in character and service.</p>

            <h3>Sucesfully self-taught 2 A-Levels</h3>
            <p>As a commitment to myself and my parents, i decided to pick myself up after being in a deep mental pit and self-taught the reformed (and more difficult!) A-Levels. Revision started only 10 days before my first exam, and i had to pay the entirety of the exam fees (totalling Â£1,162). Although i had to drop Further Mathematics (as there was no time), i achieved two B grades. The Further mathematics A-Level will be taken in Autumn of 2022. </p>

My acceptance into the program reassured me of my potential and cemented this experience as a pillar of my journey of reformation. Through it i have gained an abundance of technical and mindset knowledge, as evident by this website alone.</p>
